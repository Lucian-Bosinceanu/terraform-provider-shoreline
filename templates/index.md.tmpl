# Shoreline Provider

[Shoreline.io](https://shoreline.io/) provides real-time, automatic remediation for cloud operations.

_Automatic remediation_ centralizes auto-healing processes by preventing or fixing repetitive incidents without human intervention.

The Shoreline Provider and associated [Op Packs](https://docs.shoreline.io/op/packs) are remediation as code tools. You can easily integrate Shoreline's automated monitoring, debugging, and repairing capabilities within your Terraform configuration.

-> _Remediation as code_ adds auto-remediation tool creation and management to the same high-level, codified pipeline as the rest of your operations configuration.

Check out [Getting Started with Shoreline](https://docs.shoreline.io/getting-started) for more details!
